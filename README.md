# UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project_1 - July 2020
## Title: Community Resilience in Covid-19

#### Team #6
#### Team Members: Lukas Brun, Alexander Francesco, Colby Hoke, Connor Reside

## Project Design/Outline:
#### Using up-to-date and publicly available data sources, we would like to determine what are some factors that contribute to higher incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases between counties in NC based on variables such as community resilience and what the population demographics are for counties with a higher incidence of confirmed Covid-19 Cases.

## Initial Questions:
1. How prevalent among NC counties are COVID-19 cases?
1. What are the top 5 counties with COVID-19 cases / deaths?
1. What are the top 5 counties (per 10,000 population) with COVID-19 cases / deaths?
1. What community factors explain COVID-19 cases in NC counties?
1. Are more vulnerable communities more likely to be affected by COVID-19?
1. Do rural and urban communities show different impacts? 
1. What role do demographics play in COVID-19 cases? 
1. Is there a correlation between access to testing and cases of COVID-19?

## Hypotheses tested
1. County risk factor - As risk factors increase, COVID incidents increase
1. Age - As age increases, COVID incidents increase
1. Race - As % non-white increases, COVID incidents increase
1. Income - As poverty rate increases, COVID incidents increase
1. Urban/Rural - As population density increases, COVID incidents increase
1. Education - As % with high school education decreases, COVID incidents increase
