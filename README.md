Title: Community Resilience in Covid-19

Team Members: Lukas Brun, Alexander Francesco, Colby Hoke, Connor Reside

Project Design/Outline: 

Using up-to-date and publicly available data sources, we would like to determine what are some factors that contribute to higher incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases between counties in NC based on variables such as community resilience, population access to medical care, and what the population demographics are for counties with a higher incidence of confirmed Covid-19 Cases.

Research Questions:

1 -  To what extent do low resilient counties have higher incidence of COVID?
2 -  Is there a correlation between access to hospitals and cases of COVID-19? Do Rural vs Urban regions show different impacts? Does the average distance to hospitals affect the incidences of COVID-19 cases reported?
3 -  What county demographic factors are associated with higher incidence of COVID?

Task Breakdown:

LukasBrun - Questions 1, obtaining and interpreting data on resilience and incidences of Covid cases.
Colby Hoke - Questions 2, obtaining and interpreting data focused on the population proximity to hospital by zip code and the correlation to incidences of COVID-19.
Alexander Francesco - Questions 3, obtaining and interpreting data pertaining to demographics of the specific counties and their incidences of COVID-19.
Connor Reside - Assist in data interpretation, cleaning up of the data, and compiling the final contributions in order to produce visible graphs and interpreted information.
